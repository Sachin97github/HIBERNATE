WHILE SAVING
cascading = "none"
 - Data will not we stored
 - because Child have to store record in Parent Table

WHILE DELETION
cascade = "all" "none" 
- if we use this  cascading while delete with HQL then it wont get Any ERROR

if we try to load and delete Child
cascade ="all" it will give Integrity error
cascade= "none" it will work  but only delte Child not Parent

this Problem we can solve with HQL query for deletion
